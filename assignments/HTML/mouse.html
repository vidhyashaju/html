    <h1>MOUSE</h1>
   <P> There are lots of different styles of mouse, but most have a left and a right button.

To hold your mouse, rest your hand over it and put your index finger on the left button and your thumb resting on the side. The cable needs to be pointing towards the computer. The mouse needs to always be in contact with a mouse mat, desk or hard surface.
You use your mouse to move the cursor around the screen. The cursor changes, depending on what you are doing on the computer. As an arrow you use it for moving and selecting things, as a hand for clicking on links when you are on the internet and it becomes an hourglass when you are waiting for the computer to do something.
</P>
<h2>Single clicking</h2>
<p>
You single click with the left mouse button to select things. Just quickly left click and then let go of the button.</p>

<h2>Double clicking</h2>
<p>
You double click with the left mouse button to open things, such as a folder. You need to double click quickly, think about the ‘knock, knock’ you do on a door.
</p>
<h2>Drag and drop</h2>
<p>
Drag and drop is when you move something from one place to another. 

First select the item with the left mouse button and keep the button pressed down. Then move the mouse and the item on screen will move with the cursor. When you have the cursor and item in the position you want, release the left mouse button.

The item will now be dropped to where the cursor is positioned on the screen.

You use drag and drop to move things around your computer, such as files between folders.</p>

<h2>Right button</h2>
<p>
If you ever accidently click the right mouse button, a list of computer commands will appear. To remove the list just move the mouse and single click the left button.

Laptop trackpad or touchpad
Laptops can have a built in mouse within the keyboard. This is operated by finger touch. This specialised surface is used instead of a mouse and needs only very short finger movements to move the cursor across the display screen.
