        A keyboard is for putting information including letters, words and numbers into your computer. You press the individual buttons on the keyboard when you type. 


The number keys across the top of the keyboard are also found on the right of the keyboard. 

The letter keys are in the centre of the keyboard. 

The symbol keys to the right of the letters include symbols such as the question mark and full stop.

The keys that surround the letters, numbers and symbol keys on the left, right and bottom of the keyboard help you to choose where and how you type.
