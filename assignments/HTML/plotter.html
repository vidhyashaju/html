    <h1>PLOTTER</h1>
    <P>
        A plotter is a computer hardware device much like a printer that is used for printing vector graphics. Instead of toner, plotters use a pen, pencil, marker, or another writing tool to draw multiple, continuous lines on paper rather than multiple dots, like a traditional printer. Plotters produce a hard copy of schematics and other similar applications. Though once widely used for computer-aided design, these devices were more or less phased out by wide-format printers.

<h4>Advantages of plotters</h4>

Plotters can work on large sheets of paper while maintaining high resolution.
They can print on a wide variety of flat materials including plywood, aluminum, sheet steel, cardboard, and plastic.
Plotters allow the same pattern to be drawn thousands of times without any image degradation.
<h4>Disadvantages of plotters</h4>

Plotters are quite large compared to a traditional printer.
Plotters are also more expensive than a traditional printer.
<h5>When was the first plotter invented?</h5>

The first plotter was invented in 1953 by Remington-Rand. It was used in conjunction with the UNIVAC computer to created technical drawings.
