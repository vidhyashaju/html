    <p>
        Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a single codebase. <br>

First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017. <br>
Framework architecture
<br>
The major components of Flutter include: <br>

Dart platform
Flutter engine
Foundation library
Design-specific widgets
Flutter Development Tools (DevTools)
Dart language <br>
Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. <br>

For better performance, release versions of Flutter apps on all platforms use ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation,[18] except for on the Web where code is transpiled to JavaScript. <br>

Flutter inherits Dart's Pub package manager and software repository, which allows users to publish and use custom packages as well as Flutter-specific plugins. <br>

Flutter engine
Flutter's engine, written primarily in C++, provides low-level rendering support using either Google's Skia graphics library or the custom "Impeller" graphics layer.[16] Additionally, it interfaces with platform-specific SDKs such as those provided by Android and iOS to implement accessibility, file and network I/O, native plugin support, and more. <br>

Foundation library
The Foundation library, written in Dart, provides basic classes and functions that are used to construct applications using Flutter, such as APIs to communicate with the engine. <br>

Design-specific widgets
The Flutter framework contains two sets of widgets that conform to specific design languages: Material Design widgets implement Google's design language of the same name, and Cupertino widgets implement Apple's iOS Human interface guidelines.[17][22][23][24] Flutter allows the developer to use either set of widgets on either platform, i.e. even Cupertino widgets on Android. Third party packages can be used to automatically adjust the app's design to the current operating system. <br>

IDE support
Flutter maintains official support for the following IDEs and editors via plugins: <br>

IntelliJ IDEA
Android Studio
Visual Studio Code
Emacs <br>
Other IDEs can be used with community-supported plugins, or by using Flutter tools from the command line.[9] There are several tools emerging in the market that have started to utilize official Flutter IDE Framework and offer customized Graphical use interface builders. <br>

Widgets <br>
The basic component in a Flutter program is a "widget", which can in turn consist of other widgets. A widget describes the logic, interaction, and design of a UI element with an implementation similar to React. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits such as React Native and Xamarin which draw widgets using native platform components, Flutter renders widgets itself on a per-pixel basis.

There are two fundamental types of widgets: stateless and stateful. Stateless widgets only update if their inputs change, making them very efficient, while stateful widgets can call the setState() method to update an internal state and redraw.[26]

Although widgets are the primary method of constructing Flutter applications, they can also be bypassed in favor of directly drawing on a canvas. This feature has been occasionally used to implement game engines in Flutter.
