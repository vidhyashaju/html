    <h1>Memory</h1>
    <p>
        Memory is the electronic holding place for the instructions and data a computer needs to reach quickly. It's where information is stored for immediate use. Memory is one of the basic functions of a computer, because without it, a computer would not be able to function properly. Memory is also used by a computer's operating system, hardware and software.
<br> <br>
There are technically two types of computer memory: primary and secondary. The term memory is used as a synonym for primary memory or as an abbreviation for a specific type of primary memory called random access memory (RAM). This type of memory is located on microchips that are physically close to a computer's microprocessor.
<br><br>
If a computer's central processer (CPU) had to only use a secondary storage device, computers would become much slower. In general, the more memory (primary memory) a computing device has, the less frequently the computer must access instructions and data from slower (secondary) forms of storage.
